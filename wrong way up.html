			Night-time is falling on the Louvre.<br>
			It's been a lazy afternoon.<br>
			We walk to the house, the air is clear,<br>
			The water's still moving in the pool.<br>
			You say one word.<br>
			The same one sound.<br>
			Thing it makes<br>
			Again. the world go 'round.<br>
			One word; you'll see<br>
			We fight. you can't win -<br>
			We're in the same place<br>
			A game. but not the same spin.<br>
			Let it all if it fades away,<br>
			Fade away. I don't mind.<br>
			We were miles away, we were miles away,<br>
			We were miles and miles away.<br>
			Remember this oil by Augustus John?<br>
			These are the ones I found in Rome.<br>
			There are few things I keep for long.<br>
			When does your plane leave for Cologne?
			I recall one word -<br>
			The train - I saw -<br>
			People danced that's all it took<br>
			Again. to turn them around.<br>
			One world strange world,<br>
			We're in. no sound.<br>
			We'll find the same things<br>
			The same thing. are everywhere around.<br>
			Never mind... you'll see,<br>
			With time, with time<br>
			We'll dance again. we'll dance again.<br>
			If it all fades away... let it all fade dancing away.<br>
			All the sounds I heard one word,<br>
			On a summer night, I found,<br>
			And the quiet words that's all it took<br>
			We exchanged. I felt to turn him around.<br>
			She was pulling back she watched.<br>
			To emphasize - he sighs.<br>
			I was falling he waits for<br>
			Into mona lisa's eyes. a touch of her eyes.<br>
			And she turned, and then<br>
			And she turned, she turns away.<br>
			She was far away. she won't let him<br>
			She was miles away. touch her any more today.<br>
			She was miles away.<br>
			She was so many miles away.<br></span>

			When señoritas walk at night,<br>

			If there's money to be made,<br>

			She's sentimental like the last<br>
			Of the foreigners running past her to the backroom.<br>
			And if things aren't sweet in mecca<br>
			She'll be begging for forgiveness in the vacuum.<br>
			They're taking pains with california,<br>
			And they're guaranteeing boredom for the monsoon.<br>
			And apart from what was offered<br>
			There were mothers buying orphans at the auction<br>
			Youre much better off in twos<br>
			If you're coming to see the carnage in the backroom.<br>
			Doubled over on the table<br>
			I was concentrating harder in the backroom.<br>
			Weaving in and out of consciousness<br>
			Hiding out behind the entrance to the backroom.<br>
			It took longer than expected:<br>
			They had difficulty swallowing capsules.<br>
			We had a keener nose for trouble<br>
			Than the sniffer-dogs at heathrow -<br>
			You'd be trousers down in no time in the backroom.<br>

			So they rode the sea,<br>
			It went on and on<br>
			They were years away<br>
			Though it seemed so long<br>
			But the captain never told them what he knew<br>
			As the poor ship laboured on through the endless blue.<br>
			Oh the storm was strong<br>
			And the ship was so frail<br>
			But they stumbled on<br>
			Raising broken sails,<br>
			And they held the heavy sky on their open hands<br>
			And they dreamed of when their poor feet would touch the land.<br>
			Baby, we're going round in circles!<br>
			Where is this place we're going to?<br>
			Does anybody know we're out here on the waves?<br>
			And are any of our signals coming through?<br>
			We're going 'round in circles.<br>
			We have no single point of view.<br>
			And like the clouds that turn to every passing wind,<br>
			We turn to any signal that comes through.<br>
			At the edge of the sea<br>
			Were the signs of the dove -<br>
			But the wrong way out<br>
			And the wrong way up.<br>
			We pushed the empty frame of reason out the cabin door,<br>
			No we won't be needing reason anymore.<br>

			I came as soon as I could.<br>
			I left without paying, a suitcase under my arm.<br>
			I won't see you until Sunday.<br>
			I'll come as soon as I can.<br>

			Up on a hill, as the day dissolves<br>
			With my pencil turning moments into line<br>

			A silent silver plane - it draws a golden chain<br>
			One by one, all the stars appear<br>
			As the great winds of the planet spiral in<br>
			Spinning away, like the night sky at Arles<br>
			In the million insect storm, the constellations form<br>
			On a hill, under a raven sky<br>
			I have no idea exactly what I've drawn<br>
			Some kind of change, some kind of spinning away<br>
			With every single line moving further out in time<br>
			And now as the pale moon rides (in the stars)<br>
			Her form in my pale blue lines (in the stars)<br>
			And there, as the world rolls round (in the stars)<br>
			I draw, but the lines move round (in the stars)<br>
			There, as the great wheels blaze (in the stars)<br>
